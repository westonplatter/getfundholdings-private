# Product Requirements Document: SEC Series Lookup HTTP Fetcher

## 1. Overview

Create a generic HTTP request method to fetch series data from the SEC EDGAR series lookup page. The initial implementation will focus on retrieving series/class information for a given CIK number from the SEC's series lookup interface.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Primary Objectives
- Fetch series data from SEC series lookup page: `https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/series`
- Extract series/class information for a given CIK number
- Demonstrate compliance with SEC access requirements and legal obligations
- Provide foundation for future ETF holdings data retrieval

### 2.2 Success Criteria
- Successfully retrieve series data for IVV (CIK: 1100663)
- Parse and structure series information from HTML response
- Maintain compliance with SEC rate limiting (10 requests/second)
- Return structured data for downstream processing

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 SEC EDGAR API Compliance
- **User-Agent Header**: Must include company name and email in format `"Company Name email@domain.com"`
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 10 requests per second with 0.1 second minimum intervals
- **Error Handling**: Implement exponential backoff for HTTP 403/404 responses
- **Legal Compliance**: Maintain access logs per Computer Fraud and Abuse Act requirements

### 3.2 Data Sources
- **Primary**: SEC series lookup page `https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/series`
- **Target Fund**: IVV (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF)
- **CIK Number**: 1100663 (10-digit format with leading zeros: 0001100663)
- **Parameters**: ticker, sc=companyseries, type=N-PX, CIK, Find=Search

### 3.3 Data Processing Requirements
- Parse HTML response from series lookup page
- Extract series information including:
  - Series name
  - Series ID
  - Class/contract information
  - Any additional metadata available

### 3.4 Data Output
- Return structured data (list of dictionaries)
- Include metadata: CIK, request timestamp, response status
- Handle empty results gracefully
- Log all requests for compliance auditing

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Core Components
1. **SECHTTPClient**: Generic HTTP client with SEC-compliant headers and rate limiting
2. **SeriesLookup**: Method to fetch series data for a given CIK
3. **HTMLParser**: Parse HTML response and extract series information
4. **ResponseHandler**: Handle HTTP errors and retry logic

### 4.2 Data Flow
```
CIK Input → Series Lookup URL → HTTP Request → HTML Response → Parser → Structured Data
```

### 4.3 Error Handling
- HTTP 403: Rate limit exceeded - implement exponential backoff
- HTTP 404: Series not found - log and return empty result
- HTML parsing errors: Log error details and return partial data
- Network timeouts: Retry with exponential backoff

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core HTTP Client
- Implement SEC-compliant HTTP client with proper headers
- Add rate limiting functionality (10 requests/second)
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Phase 2: Series Lookup Method
- Create method to fetch series data for given CIK
- Build proper URL with query parameters
- Handle HTTP response and status codes

### Phase 3: HTML Parsing
- Parse HTML response from series lookup page
- Extract series information from HTML structure
- Return structured data format

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Test with IVV (CIK: 1100663) as proof of concept
- Validate compliance with SEC requirements
- Error handling and edge case testing

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### 6.1 Functional Requirements
- [ ] Successfully fetch series data for IVV (CIK: 1100663)
- [ ] Parse HTML response and extract series information
- [ ] Return structured data (list of dictionaries)
- [ ] Handle rate limiting without triggering IP blocks
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging

### 6.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Response time: < 5 seconds per request
- [ ] Rate compliance: Never exceed 10 requests/second
- [ ] Reliability: Handle network failures gracefully
- [ ] Security: No credentials or sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Compliance: All requests logged for audit purposes

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### 7.1 Legal & Compliance Risks
- **Risk**: IP blocking for non-compliance
- **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to SEC header and rate limiting requirements

### 7.2 Technical Risks
- **Risk**: HTML parsing failures on page structure changes
- **Mitigation**: Robust error handling and flexible parsing logic

### 7.3 Data Quality Risks
- **Risk**: Incomplete or malformed data extraction
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting

## 8. Success Metrics

- **Request Success Rate**: 100% successful HTTP requests
- **Compliance Rate**: 0% SEC violations or IP blocks
- **Processing Speed**: Complete series lookup in < 5 seconds
- **Error Rate**: < 1% parsing errors on valid responses

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Support for additional filing types beyond N-PX
- Batch processing for multiple CIKs
- Caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
- Integration with N-PORT holdings data fetching
